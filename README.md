##Introduction
Tetrix game created by me when I was working for few years in a company programming
on delphi language. Since I was a small kid, I wanted to create by own tetris game.
I remember that when I was studing programming in school, I had a yound lecturer
that showed us his tetris game he made, he was **very** proud of himself and said that
every real programmer MUST create at least once in his life tetris game.
I remembered his phrase and told myself that as soon as I'll have time and will, 
I'll create my own tetris game and that time came about 8 years ago, in 2008, 
I decided to implement the game in Delphi 7.
